Plugin Development
---

We happily introduced `plugins` starting from `v2.0.0-beta` of AntSword, which entails users to get more features by installing different plugins instead of modifing the core of AntSword.


For example:
`port scan`, `SOCKS proxy`, `reversed shell`, `intranet scan`, `backdoor scan`, `brute force`, `download as ZIP file`, `interactive shell`, `privilege escalation`, ... ...


This chapter will show to how to write your own plugins with an example. And make it available to other users.
